<h1>Merry Christmas!</h1>
<h2>December 25, 2021</h2>
<p>Whew, it's been quite a year! The very concept of family has been changing, people have been moving, jobs changing, lots of transition!  </p>

<h3>Ethannah</h3>
<p>To start with, on a chilly February beach day in Boston, I got engaged to Ms. Hannah Chow!  Soon after, we decided we wanted to start our life together in Washington, D.C. to be in a diverse city while being a little closer to Hannah's extended family.  So, we said our goodbyes to our friends in Boston and moved down to stay with Hannah's aunt, uncle, and cousins who warmly opened their homes to us in Rockville, MD.  I transitioned to remote work at my job, and Hannah decided to leave her position to spend some time discerning what is next.  From there, we enjoyed family meals, planned our wedding, and visited apartments in different neighborhoods in DC.  We got married on a farm in Leesburg, VA on September 25, and moved in to our cozy apartment in the Columbia Heights neighborhood of DC shortly after.  Here, we're grateful to have found a church to call home (shoutout to Northwest Community Church!), a new community development job for Hannah starting in the new year, hiking trails connecting to Rock Creek Park, and a long list of local restaurants to try.</p>  
    
<h3>Dad</h3>
<p>Dad has been thrusting himself into the retired life with weekly Great Adventures with the dogs, an Alaska cruise he's been planning for years, and lots of volunteer work.  He drives patients to medical appointments, delivers meals to seniors, and helps folks with taxes.  He was even appointed to be regional coordinator for the tax prep organization he works for!</p>

<h3>Elizabeth & Orkun</h3>
<p>After discovering that Orkun is allergic to the state of Georgia (there's a doctor's note to prove it!!), Elizabeth and Orkun deliberated and ultimately decided to plant themselves in Denver, where they are now.  I'm pretty excited to have a familial reason to spend more time in colorful Colorado.  After selling their house in Atlanta, they finally were able to return to Turkey to enjoy some time with Orkun's family for a few weeks.</p>

<h3>Reflections</h3>
<p>This year, externally, has looked like a happy dream full of romance, exciting new opportunities and growth.  However, looks can be deceiving - this was probably the hardest year of my life.  Grief, depression, the stresses of many transitions, and the difficulties of beginning a marriage have all compounded on one another to make everything feel harder than it "should" be.  Many days, we are ambushed by negative emotions that feel so trapping that we cannot get out of them by our own strength.  In the first chapter of the Gospel according to John, we read that Jesus came to give light to those living in darkness, and that the darkness has not overcome the light.  Later in scripture, the writer of the letter to the Hebrews tells us that "faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen."  Sometimes, it is easy to *see* the hope and promised light that Jesus brought.  This year we've been forced to rely on faith rather than sight to cling to the hope of our savior.  We are assured by Paul in the letter to the Romans that "this hope will not lead to disappointment. For we know how dearly God loves us, because he has given us the Holy Spirit to fill our hearts with his love."  Thank you to all of the friends and family who have shown us love and reminded us of His love.</p>

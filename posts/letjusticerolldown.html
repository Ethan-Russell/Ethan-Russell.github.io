<h1>Let Justice Roll Down - John M. Perkins</h1>
<h2>11/27/2020</h2>
<p>I read this book yesterday while sharpening some old chisels and hand planes.  Sometimes, mindless work helps the mind to focus on something greater than self.  Anyway, this book was riveting and I want to start posting some thoughts and reflections on books that I read to help process and have a point of reference for to return to.</p>

<p>This is essentially a memoir of John's life from 1930-1976, when this was written.  This man has been through a lot, and is still living.  He grew up as a black share-cropper in Mindenhall, Mississippi.  He was born roughly 45 minutes from where I was born in Flowood, MS.  But he had it very different than I.  His brother was murdered by police when John was in his early teens and he moved to Monrovia California shortly after.  He was a super hard worker and carried with him a lifelong commitment to seeking economic justice after seeing very little of it in his upbringing.  He found a little more justice in Monrovia where he was able to work for the same pay as his white counterparts.</p>

<p>Perkins was exposed to the teachings of Jesus through his wife (a lifelong Christian), and spent a lot of time wrestling with Paul's life and testimony.  Paul possessed some serious zeal for the Lord, with a true heart for all people, oppressors and otherwise.  Perkins was clutched by God during a sermon on Paul's exhortation:</p>

<blockquote>
    For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. - Romans 6:23
</blockquote>

<p>Perkins considered himself a bit of an economist and was repulsed by greed and oppression.  He had all of Paul's zeal for justice, yet did not have the heart of love and peace towards his oppressors.  After turning to the Lord, Perkins and his wife jumped into bible studies, child evangelism, and rethinking economic practices with a group of Christian business leaders.</p>

<p>When reading about the dedication, passion and fruit of a man such as this, it is hard not to feel a tinge of envy, or maybe even guilt.  This man, who was dealt so little, did so much beautiful work for the kingdom!  And here I am, dealt a pretty full hand of cards born a stones throw away from Mr. Perkins, living a (in my mind) seemingly meaningless life.  I think about the parable of the talents, where I feel I am the servant who was given much and much is expected from.  Then you have John, who was given very little, and did so much.  The game of comparison is such a dangerous game.  It opens the door to the enemy to sow seeds of discontentment into the path we are on, regardless of whether or not it is a Godly path.  Then I also wonder if I am being greedy for glory - I want to serve God in this way that bears much fruit and is beautiful, when maybe God wants me to humble my heart in the place he put me with the intention to bring himself glory in an entirely different, yet equally beautiful way.  Who knows, but God?  Either way a humbling before Him is in order.</p>

<p>John perkins did a lot with facilitating beautiful Christian community where it was most needed.  These strong, mostly black Christian communities were able to have the unity, endurance, and love to cause some big change in race relations, restoring dignity to the oppressed, feeding the hungry, sheltering the homeless, granting healthcare to the oppressed.  He started small in the town he grew up in (after being called back there from cozy California), and God has, with much pain and suffering, multiplied his efforts.  John Perkins even founded the Christian Community Development Association, which <a href="https://www.highrockarlington.org/">my church</a> has recently joined.  I'm so excited that I can play a baby part in this movement: the redemption and restoration of the world to Christ, one loaf of bread at a time.  Some weeks we have fish too.</p>

<p>My words cannot adequately the reverence I have towards this man's life and work.  Reading the words he penned, the heart just rings with his humility, self-sacrifice, and devotion to the way of love.</p>

<blockquote>
    My deepest desire has been that the reconciling love that God displayed on the cross would spread into all the world, and that somehow I could participate in that mission. - John M. Perkins

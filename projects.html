                    During the summer of 2017 I took it upon myself to germinate a lemon tree.  My sister Elizabeth has always had a strong affinity for strange houseplants, and she enjoys consuming lemons, so I thought I'd combine those two passions into a long-con birthday present for her.  Little did I know it would turn into a (friendly?) competition to see who would harvest the first lemon.

                    This monstrosity was bourn out of various parts scavenged from a fraternity house, the desire to carry musical instruments to campus without using a motorized vehicle, and the sheer joy of carrying ridiculous things on a bicycle.  There's a special feeling to thundering down the bike path with a pair of guitars in tow.

                    I received an invitation for the wedding of two of my closest friends, and being me, I decided to express my love for them with a ridiculously time-consuming project.  In this case, I decided to opt for a queen-sized afghan.  This project is the culmination of ~150 hours of work, and was worth every minute of it!

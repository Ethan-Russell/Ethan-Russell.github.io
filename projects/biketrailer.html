                    This monstrosity was bourn out of various parts scavenged from a fraternity house, the desire to carry musical instruments to campus without using a motorized vehicle, and the sheer joy of carrying ridiculous things on a bicycle.  There's a special feeling to thundering down the bike path with a pair of guitars in tow.
                    Now for some spefications.  I own a guitar and an electric keyboard.  I desired to carry either of these instruments via bicycle without paying a single cent to do so.

                        *Note that these were in the cave (the room at Pike that I lived in) for at least 4 years, and that of the dozens of people who tried, none were able to conquer the orbit wheels.  I would venture to say that they are a cool concept but unusable except for the rare early 2000's child prodigy.  I didn't feel too bad for dedicating them to the cause, though I did not damage them irreparably - only 4 small holes in the platform.  Check <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0x9Ph-qWT8">them</a> out for yourself.

                    I'm not particularly proud of the design of this contraption, nor do I want anyone to replicate it, so I won't go into the details of its creation.  Just wanted to share a project that brought me unprecedented joy and a trivial amount of transportation freedom from very little time and resources.  If you have similar ambitions, I encourage you to go for it!  I was able to carry my electric keyboard, or my guitar, or my roomate Caleb's bass guitar, or both guitars (pictured)

                    <strong>Full disclaimer:</strong>  One iteration of the attachment/hitch mechanism was not well thought out and resulted in my dropping the trailer laden with my electric keyboard after hitting a bump, rendering the hitch mechanism useless.  The keyboard was unaffected, though my pride greviously injured.  I have employed the most recent iteration of the hitch mechanism numerous occasions without fail.  It involves a loop of utility cord attached to the trailer resting in a metal hook on the hitch.  If you do undertake a trailer design, I admonish you not to overlook the signifiicance of a sound hitch design :).

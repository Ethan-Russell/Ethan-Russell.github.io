        <p>I regrettably haven't posted in over a year.  Much has happened in the past year, and I hope to post more frequently, maybe with a little less polish and less complete.  So, I'm sharing about something I made, a little stool. </p>

        <p>Hannah and I host a weekly small group bible study at our apartment.  It has been a small crew of 4 of us, with a few others joining more recently.  It has been a huge gift to grow closer together and study the scriptures together.  Every week at the end of our time together, Glenda would sit on the floor to put her shoes back on.  Every time, it broke my heart that she had no place to sit!  Our entryway is too small for a chair, and I had dreams of building a stool to fit in that spot.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, we were blessed with 4 new-to-us, very sturdy dining room chairs from our local Facebook Buy Nothing group, which displaced our very wobbly old chairs.  Instead of retiring them to the curb, I decided to repurpose one into a little stool for our entryway.</p>

    <p>It was surprisingly easy and remarkably satisfying to disassemble the chair using only my hands.  None of the glue binding the joints put up much of a fight at this point in its lifetime.</p>

    <p>With some technique help from Rex Krueger, one of my favorite wood-workers, I sawed off part of the seat with my little Japanese hand saw and whittled and rounded the sharp edges of the seat with a knife.  I bore new holes through the maple seat in the thickest, least-recessed parts after calculating and measuring some important angles.  I trimmed off previously joined portion from the legs, whittled down, trimmed, and cut slits in the legs, then cut little oak wedges to drive into the legs to make them even more snug and sturdy in the seat.  I glued it all together and drove the wedges, then used a chisel to clean up the top of the legs, and called it quits.  One day, Hannah might paint something fun on it.

        <h2>A brief soliloquy about one of my favorite tools.</h2>
        <p>Meet this thingy.  It is called a brace.  You put drill bits into it and turn it with your hands, holding the top part against your shoulder.  Think of it as an old-school version of an electric drill.  On top of being a good workout, it is easy to adjust the angle as you go and easy to get to a precise depth.  It is surprisingly fast to drill consistent and clean holes of any size (1 inch holes for this project!).  Sadly, they are fading in popularity due to the prevalence of the electric drill, but I would love to change that!

            <p>The secret sauce is in the the bits.  They are called auger bits, and are an ingenious invention that has been around for over 200 years!  They have a screw tip that bores into the wood and pulls the rest of the bit along.  There is a sharp blade along the outside of the bit, and a chisel-like part inside to scoop out the waste.  They are easy to resharpen with a file, and will last for years.  My set is probably over 50 years old.  I can drill a hole faster through softwood by hand than I could with an electric drill, and have much more fun doing it, all while making very little noise (an important neighborly consideration for other apartment-dwellers).  An amazing and fun tool that I use all the time for boring any kind of hole, or even driving screws.

            <p>Anyway, I'm really happy with the way the stool turned out.  Somehow, the angles turned out right so it is sturdy and not tippy.  I think it's kind of cute, despite that it relatively simple and crude.  It conveys a sense of warmth and care, and tucks nicely into the corner.  Here is a photo of Glenda enjoying the stool.
